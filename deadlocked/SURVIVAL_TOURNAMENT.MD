## Outline

[Survival](./GAME_MODES.MD#survival) is a custom, multiplayer PvE game mode for Ratchet: Deadlocked Online. Players must survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies by upgrading, unlocking, and fighting for their lives.

Our Survival Tournament pits teams of two against one another. Over the duration of the event, duos may play as many games of Survival as they want. The duo with the longest run (most rounds survived) win a prize. Prizes also are provided to the second and third runner ups.

## Rules

In order to qualify for our Survival Tournaments, there are a few rules you must follow to keep it fair.

### Horizon Discord

You must join our [discord](https://discord.gg/horizonps) to be able to participate! All communication and submissions go through our discord so please join if you are interested in participating.

### Start and End Dates

Each Survival Tournament will have a start and end date. Your run must BEGIN within those two dates. If you start before the start date or after the end date, it will not count.

If your run *finishes* after the end date, it will still count.

### 2 Players

You must begin the game with exactly 2 players. Local players are not allowed. You must play with another person.

### Submissions

You must submit a link to a VOD (Twitch/YouTube) showing the entire run, start to finish. This submission must occur before the final submission date (usually 3 days after the end of the tournament).

### Number of Submissions per Player

You may play with as many different partners as you'd like, but you may only submit one run with your name on it. Even if you get the first and second highest score, each with different partners, only one will count. This is to prevent the same person from winning multiple times.

## Prizes

Cash prizes are distributed to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place runs. Amount and distribution can change per tournament.

We can send money via Venmo, Cashapp, or PayPal. If you do not have any of those, or wish to not share them with us, we can also send you a digital gift card to the digital storefront of your choosing.

## Past Tournaments
