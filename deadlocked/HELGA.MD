# Helga Discord Bot

Helga is a Discord bot that is a great resource for several DL-related tasks, as follows!

Helga tracks stats for various Deadlocked game modes.
- To see your stats for the Survival game mode, type the following command in the `#bot-commands` channel in our Discord: `/deadlocked stats Survival ACCOUNTNAME` (where ACCOUNTNAME is your exact profile name as shown on the DL profile edit page).

Helga also:
- Tracks who is currently online on DL. To see a list of who is currently online, check the `#dl-players-online` channel in our Discord.
- Shares new videos uploaded to the Horizon Youtube channel, and posts whenever someone is streaming UYA or DL online. All of this can be found in the `#media` channel.

More info coming soon!
