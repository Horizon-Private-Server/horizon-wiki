# Deadlocked Custom Maps

The Horizon server enables users to play on custom maps. _For Deadlocked, custom maps currently work for the NTSC-U/C (North American) version of the game only._

Some initial set up is required to play on custom maps. Refer to the setup guides for [PS2](/getting-online/ps2/README.md#custom-map-setup) or [PCSX2](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#custom-map-setup) as needed.

NOTE: If you receive a message stating you do not have custom maps enabled then you must install the map modules before you can play.

### Installing Map Modules

Each time you boot your PS2/emulator you must install the custom map modules in order to load the custom maps in game.

1. Open the patch menu and navigate to the Custom Maps tab.
