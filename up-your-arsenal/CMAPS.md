## Usage
To play on a custom map is simple, and works the same whether using PS2 or PCSX2.

### Enabling Custom Maps

This can be done from the main "Online Play" screen or any later screen. It must be done each time you log in, unless you set the "Enable Custom Maps on Login" mod menu setting.

1. Press the Start button to bring up the mod menu. In the "Custom Maps" tab, select "Install Custom Map Modules" to install the maps.

2. In the prompt that pops up, confirm that you would like to enable custom maps.

3. Wait a few seconds. Another message should pop up indicating that maps were successfully enabled.

### Hosting a Game on Custom Maps

1. Create a game as you would normally.

2. From the staging screen, press the Start button to bring up the mod menu. In the "Game Settings" tab, change the "Map Override" selection to the desired custom map.

3. Close the patch menu to save the new game settings.

4. Note that each player in the game must install the custom maps separately (not just the host). Any users who do not have custom maps properly installed per the steps above will not be able to "ready up" or play on them.

## Map List
More custom maps are being released all the time. As of December 2023, there are over 20 custom maps available.  
- Note: [Bots](/up-your-arsenal/bots.md) do not yet work on custom maps.
