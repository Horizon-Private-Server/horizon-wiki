# UYA Betas & Prototypes

Support for some UYA Betas and Prototypes has been added to the Horizon UYA Test server.

The betas are early versions of UYA that were shown during press releases and testing, before UYA was officially released in 2004.

Supported versions:

| Version | Region | Features |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| June 20th, 2004  | NTSC | Only has Hoven/X12. Earlyish graphics. |
| June 23rd, 2004  | NTSC | Only has Hoven/X12. Earlyish graphics. |
| August 11th, 2004  | NTSC | Only has Hoven/X12/BWC. Has a debug menu that replaces the map, which can modify lots of things in-game. |

## How do I play the betas?
### PCSX2
1. Obtain an ISO file of the beta you want to play. **NOTE: Depending on where you live, ISO downloads available online may or may not be legal. If using an illegal ISO, you agree to completely release the UYA Staff, DL Staff, and all other members of the online community from any liability resulting from your actions.**
2. You need to patch the ISO file so that it can pass through DNAS. You will need to follow the next few steps on a Windows machine. First, download `DNAS_PATCHER21.7z` from [this link](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/).
3. Extract the `.exe` file and the ISO into the same folder using 7-zip. *Note: You may have to temporarily disable your antivirus software to successfully extract the files.*
4. Drag and drop the ISO file over the `.exe` file. It will open a black Command Prompt window saying that it is scanning the ISO.
5. Once the Command Prompt window disappears, check the "date modified" for the ISO beta file. If the patch tool worked correctly, the date/time should have changed to the latest time.
6. Now you can open the ISO in PCSX2 as you would normally.
7. Set the DNS to the UYA Test server DNS. You can find this in the [Horizon Discord](https://discord.gg/horizonps).
8. Login and play! (If you see an error pop up, reset PCSX2. If no error pops up, just keep trying to login).

### PS2
[Not Tested] [Rough outline] [Run at your own risk]
- You need Freemcboot
- Burn the patched ISO file from the PCSX2 steps to a DVD-R
