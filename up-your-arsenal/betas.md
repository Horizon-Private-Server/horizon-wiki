## How do I play the betas?
### PCSX2
1. Obtain an ISO file of the beta you want to play
2. You need to patch the ISO file so that it can pass through DNAS. You will need to follow the next few steps on a Windows machine. First, download `DNAS_PATCHER21.7z` from [this link](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/)
3. Extract the `.exe` file and the ISO into the same folder. 
4. Drag and drop the ISO file over the `.exe` file. It will open a black command prompt saying that it is scanning the ISO.
5. The "date modified" for the ISO beta file should now be the latest time.
6. Now you can open the ISO in PCSX2 as you would normally.
7. Set the DNS to the UYA Test server DNS. You can find this in the [Horizon Discord](https://discord.gg/horizonps)
8. Login and play! (if you an error pop up, reset PCSX2. if no error pop up, just keep trying to login)

### PS2
[Not Tested] [Rough outline] [Run at your own risk]
- You need Freemcboot
- Burn the patched ISO file from the PCSX2 steps to a DVD-R
