# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Textures

We have several community members who have created custom texture packs for UYA. These texture packs give the UYA/R&C 3 maps, skins, and weapons you know and love a brand new look.  

See these examples of gameplay on various texture-modified maps:  
- [Mars Hoven Gorge and Outpost X12 Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNwz_Zes7kQ)
- ["Metroxic" Metropolis Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upLPPcDtHkE)
- [Lazertag Marcadia Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er6LzNtXjJ4)


__IMPORTANT: All UYA/R&C 3 texture packs are currently compatible with PCSX2 1.7 only. They do not work on PS2.__  

However, they ARE compatible with both NTSC-U/C (Up Your Arsenal) and PAL (Ratchet & Clank 3) on PCSX2.

## Setup
Some set up is required to use the texture packs. There are some initial setup steps that only have to be performed once, and "as-needed" setup to add and remove the chosen textures.  

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeIxdx_K-Bg) for a video tutorial, or read on for written directions.  

### First Time Setup
This section only needs to be done once.  
1. In your PCSX2 installation folder, create a subfolder called "textures" if it does not already exist.  
2. For NTSC ISO: In the "textures" folder, create a subfolder called "SCUS-97353" (without the quotes). OR - For PAL ISO: In the "textures" folder, create a subfolder called "SCES-52456". This will match the game code of your ISO on the PCSX2 home screen.  
3. Within the folder created in step 2, create a subfolder called "replacements".  
4. Within PCSX2, navigate to Settings -> Graphics -> Texture Replacement tab.  
5. In the "Search Directory" field, set the folder path to [your PCSX2 installation folder]\textures.  
6. In the "Options" section, enable the "Load Textures" setting.
7. Still within the Graphics settings, navigate to the Rendering tab.  
8. In the "Mipmapping" field, select "Basic (Generated Mipmaps)".  

### Adding Textures
This section should be done as needed.  
1. Download and extract the desired texture files. You may need a tool like 7-zip to extract .rar files.  
2. Locate the folder that contains the textures you want to use. Copy or move the entire folder into the "replacements" folder that was previously created. In general, copy/move the lowest level folder (the one that has all of the image files directly within it).  
3. If any existing textures will conflict with the new ones you just copied in, move them out of the "replacements" folder or delete them. The following rules apply for conflicts:  
  a) You can use one mod per map feature. For example, there should only be one mod for Bakisi Isles water in use at a time.  
  b) You can use one mod per weapon.  
  c) You can use one mod per skin per team color (so up to 8 skin mods in total, if each one is for a different color).  
  Conflicting textures will cause glitchy overlapping or weird visuals.  


## Texture Downloads
This section contains links to various texture downloads.
