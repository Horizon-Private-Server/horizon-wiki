# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Textures

We have several community members who have created custom texture packs for UYA. These texture packs give the UYA/R&C 3 maps, skins, and weapons you know and love a brand new look.  

See these examples of gameplay on various texture-modified maps:  
- [Mars Hoven Gorge and Outpost X12 Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNwz_Zes7kQ)
- ["Metroxic" Metropolis Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upLPPcDtHkE)
- [Lazertag Marcadia Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er6LzNtXjJ4)


__IMPORTANT: All UYA/R&C 3 texture packs are currently compatible with PCSX2 1.7 only. They do not work on PS2.__  

However, they ARE compatible with both NTSC-U/C (Up Your Arsenal) and PAL (Ratchet & Clank 3) on PCSX2.
