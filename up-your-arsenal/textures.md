# February 2025: Due to PCSX2 software changes, the custom textures detailed on this page can no longer be used with current versions of PCSX2. This page is no longer being updated, and is being kept only for historical purposes. If you really want to try the textures, you will need to download an older version of PCSX2 to run separately from your current version. See the Setup section below for details.

# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Textures

We have several community members who have created custom texture packs for UYA. These texture packs give the UYA/R&C 3 maps, skins, and weapons you know and love a brand new look.  

See these examples of gameplay on various texture-modified maps:  
- [Mars Hoven Gorge and Outpost X12 Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNwz_Zes7kQ)
- ["Metroxic" Metropolis Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upLPPcDtHkE)
- [Lazertag Marcadia Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er6LzNtXjJ4)


__IMPORTANT: All UYA/R&C 3 texture packs are currently compatible with PCSX2 1.7 only. They do not work on PS2.__  

However, they ARE compatible with both NTSC-U/C (Up Your Arsenal) and PAL (Ratchet & Clank 3) on PCSX2.

## Setup
Some set up is required to use the UYA/R & C 3 texture packs. Refer to our [PCSX2 Setup Guide FAQ](/getting-online/pcsx2/detailed_setup.md#custom-pcsx2-textures) for how to set up these and other custom texture packs! Be sure to set the "Mipmapping" setting (in the Graphics tab -> Rendering) to "Basic (Generated Mipmaps)". **NOTE: This setting was removed from PCSX2 after version 1.7.5828. You will need this version or a prior one in order for some UYA/R&C 3 custom textures to display correctly. If using newer versions, some custom textures will display correctly but others will not. You can always run version 1.7.5828 alongside your current updated version if you want to try out the textures.**
