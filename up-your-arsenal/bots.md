# Multiplayer Bots

Multiplayer bots have been created to play alongside or against other bots and players.

## Game Settings Supported
Maps: Marcadia Palace only
Game Mode: Deathmatch only (FFA or teams). CTF: Coming soon!
Weapons: Cycle only (Gravity Bomb, Blitz, Flux)

**If the game settings do not match above, the bots will not join.**

## Inviting Bots
Open the patch menu in Staging using the START button on the controller. Set the bot mode you want to invite (detailed below), and the difficulty you want to invite. Custom Profile does nothing for now. Select the number of bots you want to invite. Then click the "INVITE BOT(S)" button.

## Bot Modes
### Dynamic
In this bot mode bots will fight back and the difficulty you select before inviting will be used. 

### Training Idle
This bot mode is a training mode where the bots will simply follow you and stand still. Useful for flux training

### Training Passive
This bot mode is a training mode where the bots will strafe and jump like how they will in a real game.
