# Multiplayer Bots

Multiplayer bots have been created to play alongside or against other bots and players. Currently the bots only play **Team Deathmatch** and will not play Siege/CTF. Support for those modes will come later. 

**IMPORTANT**: Only invite bots after all normal players have joined the game

Bots can be invited using the normal "Invite Player" menu within the game. Below is a table of the bot names to invite:

| Bot name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| cpu0  | Basic CPU that will just follow around other players. Does not fire any weapons  |
| cpu1  | CPU that will fight but has low accuracy |
| cpu2  | CPU that will fight but has better accuracy than cpu1 |
| cpu3  | CPU that will fight but has better accuracy than cpu2 |
| cpu4  | CPU that will fight but has better accuracy than cpu3. Can cycle weapons |
| cpug  | [**EPILEPSY WARNING**] God mode CPU that has 1000 health and no limits on weapon firing and has aimhack |

## FAQ
1. How many bots can I invite?
- You can invite as many bots as there are slots.


2. How do I make the bot change team?
- To make them change colors, you can use the "request team change" in staging


3. Why did the bot leave the game?
- The CPUs will only stay in the game for 15 minutes once they enter staging (to prevent abuse). If it was earlier, please post in #uya-crash-logs on discord


4. It takes a long time to kick a bot from a game
- Yeah it takes about 45 seconds
