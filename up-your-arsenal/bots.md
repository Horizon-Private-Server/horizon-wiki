# Multiplayer Bots

Multiplayer bots have been created to play alongside or against other bots and players.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Currently the bots only play **Team Deathmatch** and will not play Siege/CTF. Support for those modes will come later.
- Only invite bots after all human players have joined the game.

## Inviting Bots
Bots can be invited using the normal "Invite Player" menu within the game. Once you send the invite, the bot can take up to 3 minutes to join the game.
Below is a table of the bot names to invite:

| Bot name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| cpu0  | Basic CPU that will just follow around other players. Does not fire any weapons  |
| cpu1  | CPU that will fight but has low accuracy |
| cpu2  | CPU that will fight but has better accuracy than cpu1 |
| cpu3  | CPU that will fight but has better accuracy than cpu2 |
| cpu4  | CPU that will fight but has better accuracy than cpu3. Can cycle weapons |
| cpug  | [**EPILEPSY WARNING**] [**WARNING: CAN CRASH YOUR PS2 IF MULTIPLE OF THESE BOTS JOIN**] God mode CPU that has 1000 health and no limits on weapon firing and has aimhack. See the bottom of this page for the CPUG challenge! |

## FAQ
1. How many bots can I invite?
- You can invite as many bots as there are slots.

2. How do I make the bot change teams?
- To make them change colors, you can use the "request team change" in staging.

3. Why did the bot leave the game?
- By default, the CPUs will only stay in the game for 15 minutes once they enter staging (to prevent abuse). However, you can have the bots stay longer by adding the number of hours with a dash in the invite. For example, cpu4-5 would be inviting a cpu4 for 5 hours of gameplay.

4. It takes a long time to kick a bot from a game!
- Yeah - it typically takes about 45 seconds.

5. I think I found a bug!
- Please post in the #uya-crash-logs channel on our Discord.

6. Where can I find the source code for multiplayer bots?
- Right over [here](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-uya-bot).


## CPUG Challenge
Beat the CPU God and earn the Godlike role on our Discord server! This role will be highlighted in the list of online players, and your name will show up in a special color.

To challenge the bot, create a game with the following settings:
- Map = Marcadia Palace
- Mode = Deathmatch
- Frag Limit >= 10
- Teams = On (remember, bots only play Team Deathmatch mode at this time). However, you must 1v1 the bot. You cannot defeat it alongside other players.
- Weapons: Either Blitz/Flux/Gravity or Flux Only
Once you create the lobby, invite the bot per instructions above.

No cheats or hacks are allowed. You also must record the game. A smartphone, etc. recording is fine if you do not have a capture card. Send Fourbolt or DeathBySnowman a video recording (publicly or privately) of the entire game. They will verify that the win is legitimate, then award you the Godlike role!
