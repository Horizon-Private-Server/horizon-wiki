# Big Al Discord bot

Big Al is a Discord bot that was written by Horizon developers. However, as of this writing it has been replaced by the [Helga Discord bot](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/HELGA.MD).

Previous Big Al commands included:
- `!skins [username]` -- get cheat codes to obtain [secret skins for UYA and DL](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/skins.md)
- `!uyaStats [username]` -- get some user's UYA stats
- `!uyaAdvStats [username]` -- get some user's more advanced UYA stats
- `!uyaAlt [username]` -- get all accounts associated with a UYA user. NOTE: If the user name uses the character "#", type "%23" instead of "#" in your message.
- `!uyaClan [clan name]` -- get stats and members about a UYA clan
- `!uyaTeams 0` -- generate balanced UYA teams based on a machine learning model that is trained on game history, maps, player stats, and game mode
- `!uyaElo [username]` -- get a user's UYA ELO rank for all game modes
