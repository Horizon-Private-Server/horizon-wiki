# Big Al Discord bot

Big Al is a Discord bot that is a great resource for several UYA-related tasks, as follows!

In the `#bot-commands` channel of the Horizon Discord, type one of the following commands exactly as shown on the left side of the "--", and the bot will reply with the action shown on the right side.
- `!skins [username]` -- get cheat codes to obtain [secret skins for UYA and DL](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/skins.md)
- `!uyaStats [username]` -- get some user's UYA stats
- `!uyaAdvStats [username]` -- get some user's more advanced UYA stats
- `!uyaAlt [username]` -- get all accounts associated with a UYA user. NOTE: If the user name uses the character "#", type "%23" instead of "#" in your message.
- `!uyaClan [clan name]` -- get stats and members about a UYA clan
- `!uyaTeams 0` -- generate balanced UYA teams based on a machine learning model that is trained on game history, maps, player stats, and game mode
- `!uyaElo [username]` -- get a user's UYA ELO rank for all game modes

Big Al also tracks who is currently online on UYA. To see a list of who is currently online, check the `#uya-players-online` channel in our Discord.
