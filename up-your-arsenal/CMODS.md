# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Mods

The Horizon server enables users to play with various custom mods. For UYA, we offer both NTSC-U/C and PAL support for mods.

Unlike custom maps, no extra setup is required to use custom mods!

Important notes:
- Some settings are per player (meaning that different players can configure them differently in the same game), while others are for the entire game lobby and can only be changed by the game host.
- Certain game rules will only show if you are playing a certain game type (for example, the Auto Respawn setting only shows in Deathmatch games, Gatling Health only shows if Base Defenses are on, etc.)

## Usage

1. Create or join a game as you would normally.

2. From the staging screen, press the Start button to bring up the mod menu.

3. In the "Game Settings" tab, change the available mod selections as desired.

4. Close the patch menu to save the new game settings.

## List of Available Mods

We do our best to keep this list up to date, but it may be incomplete. Check out the "General" and "Game Settings" tabs of the in-game mod menu for all available mods. Some mods may not fully work yet. If you experience issues, please post them in the `#uya-crash-logs` channel of our Discord.

### General Mods
These mods are located on the "General" tab.
- Install Custom Maps on Login - Option to automatically enable custom maps when you log in.
- Progressive Scan - Option to enable progressive scan, in case you forgot to when booting up the game.
- Level of Detail - Option to change the displayed level of detail.
- Camera Shake - Option to turn off camera shake (e.g. on Gravity Bomb impacts).

### Game Rules Mods
These mods are located on the "Game Settings" tab, when applicable.
- Map Override - Choose a custom map to play on.
- Respawn Timer - Set the respawn timer from 0 seconds to 10 seconds.
- Penalty Timers [Siege/CTF only] - Option to turn off the default "penalty timer" (extra respawn time when your team's base is out).
- Weapon Pack Spawning - Select from normal behavior (spawn on player respawn), spawn on player death, and none.
- V2s - Select from normal behavior, no V2s, or always V2s.
- Damage Cooldown - Option to enable/disable damage cooldown (the delay between registering a hit on an opposing player, and being able to hit them again).
- Fix Wallsniping - Option for flux rifle shots to not count as often if the shooting player is hanging on a ledge.
- Fix Flux Niking - Option to dramatically reduce the possibility of fLux rifle shots "niking" (deal 20 damage instead of the full 87 [or 100 for V2s]).
- Health boxes - Option to turn off health boxes.
- Auto Respawn [Deathmatch only] - Option to force players to respawn when the respawn timer hits zero.

### Base/Node Modifications
These mods are located on the "Game Settings" tab, when applicable (i.e. for Siege/CTF only, and if the Base Defenses setting in the standard game setup menu is also set to Yes).
- Gatling Turret Health - Option to buff the health of Gatling Turrets and the power core in the base up to 400% of their default values.
- Bots [Troopers, Ball Bots, etc.] - Option to turn the base troopers and ball bots on or off.
- Small Turrets - Option to turn the small auto turrets at the base on or off.

### Party Rules Mods
These mods are located on the "Game Settings" tab, when applicable.
- Survivor [Deathmatch only] - Option to prevent players from respawning on death.
- Chargeboot Forever - Chargeboot till you drop!

### Permanent Mods
The Horizon server also features some patches that are always active. This means that you will not see these settings in the mod menu, but they are features that are present in the Horizon server that were not present in the original UYA servers.
- No Dead Jumping/Crouching - Players are no longer able to "dead jump" (continue hopping around the map after they reach 0 HP).
- No Dead Shooting - Players are no longer able to shoot and damage other players after they reach 0 HP.
- No Kill Stealing - The player who causes an opposing player to reach 0 HP, will get the credit for the kill even if a teammate shoots the player again before the opponent hits the ground.
- Fix Weapon Shot Lag - Shots are much more likely to "count" on the screen of the shooting player.
- Persistent Weapon Ordering - In lobbies where 3 or fewer weapons are enabled, the weapons will remain in the same order when the player respawns.
