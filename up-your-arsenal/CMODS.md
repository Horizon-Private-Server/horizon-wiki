# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Mods

The Horizon server enables users to play with various custom mods. For UYA, we offer both NTSC-U/C and PAL support for mods.

Unlike custom maps, no extra setup is required to use custom mods!

Important notes:
- Some settings are per player (meaning that different players can configure them differently in the same game), while others are for the entire game lobby and can only be changed by the game host.
- Certain game rules will only show if you are playing a certain game type (for example, the Auto Respawn setting only shows in Deathmatch games, Gatling Health only shows if Base Defenses are on, etc.)

## Usage

1. Create or join a game as you would normally.

2. From the staging screen, press the Start button to bring up the mod menu.

3. In the "Game Settings" tab, change the available mod selections as desired.

4. Close the patch menu to save the new game settings.
