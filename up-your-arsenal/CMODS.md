# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Mods

The Horizon server enables users to play with various custom mods. For UYA, we offer both NTSC-U/C and PAL support for mods.

Unlike custom maps, no extra setup is required to use custom mods!

## Usage

Note that some settings are per player, meaning that players can configure them differently in the same game. Other settings are for the entire game lobby and can only be changed by the game host.

1. Create or join a game as you would normally.

2. From the staging screen, press the Start button to bring up the mod menu.

3. In the "Game Settings" tab, change the available mod selections as desired.

4. Close the patch menu to save the new game settings.
