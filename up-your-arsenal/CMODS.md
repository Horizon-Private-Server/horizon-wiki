# Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) Custom Mods

The Horizon server enables users to play with various custom mods. For UYA/R&C 3, we offer both NTSC-U/C and PAL support for mods.

Unlike custom maps, no extra setup is required to use custom mods! Once online, just press the Start button from any screen to access the mod menu.

New mods are being developed and released frequently. Some mods seen in the menu may not fully work yet. If you experience issues, please post them in the `#uya-crash-logs` channel of our Discord.

There are three categories of mods: General, Game Settings, and Permanent. Read on for a brief description of each category.


## General Mods
These mods are located on the "General" tab of the mod menu.  

Important notes about General mods:  
- General mods are configurable by each player, meaning that different players within the same lobby may choose different General mod settings.
- General mod settings can be acccessed by hitting the Start button on any lobby screen.
- General mods can also be accessed and changed during the game by pressing the Start button, and then selecting "Patch Config".*


## Game Settings Mods
These mods are located on the "Game Settings" tab of the mod menu, when applicable.

Important notes about Game Settings mods:  
- Game Settings mods are only configurable by the game host.
- Game Settings mods are only configurable before the game begins (i.e. in the Staging screen). The selected mods will apply for all players in the lobby.
- Certain Game Settings mods will only show if you are playing a certain game type (for example, the Auto Respawn setting only shows in Deathmatch games, Gatling Health only shows if Base Defenses are on, etc.)  


## Permanent Mods
Permanent mods are patches that are always active. This means that you will not see these settings in the mod menu, but they are features that are present in the Horizon server that were not present in the original UYA/R&C 3 servers.

Here is a list of permanent mods (this list may not be fully up-to-date):
- No Dead Jumping/Crouching - Players are no longer able to "dead jump" (continue hopping around the map after they reach 0 HP).
- No Dead Shooting - Players are no longer able to shoot and damage other players after they reach 0 HP.
- No Kill Stealing - The player who causes an opposing player to reach 0 HP, will get the credit for the kill even if a teammate shoots the player again before the opponent hits the ground.
- Fix Weapon Shot Lag - Shots are much more likely to "count" on the screen of the shooting player.
- Persistent Weapon Ordering - In lobbies where 3 or fewer weapons are enabled, the weapons will remain in the same order when the player respawns.
- Kill/Frag Limit Change: When creating games, can now select a frag limit up to 50 (instead of 35).
- Time Limit Change: When creating games, can now select a time limit up to 120 minutes (instead of 35 minutes).
