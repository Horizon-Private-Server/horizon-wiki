# Colored Clan Tags

## Colored Clan Tags
You are able to customize colors in your clan tags without the need for cheats or hacks. Fourbolt has built a way to do this through the standard menus. Listed below are the steps to add colors to your clan tags:

1. Set your clan message to the exact text `Colors 1` (or `Colors 2` or `Colors 3` depending on what you want your tag to be).
2. Set your clan tag using the mapping below to set your clan tag.
3. Exit the clans screen, and go to the clans screen again.
4. You should see your custom colored clan tag.
5. Set your clan message to whatever else you'd like.

### Clan Color Mappings:
Clan message: `Colors 1`:
```
1 -> Default color
2 -> Blue
3 -> Green
4 -> Pink
5 -> White
6 -> Gray
7 -> Black
```

Clan message: `Colors 2`:
```
a -> Default color
b -> Blue
c -> Green
d -> Pink
e -> White
f -> Gray
g -> Black
```

Clan message: `Colors 3`:
```
A -> Default color
B -> Blue
C -> Green
D -> Pink

```
