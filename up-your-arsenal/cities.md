# Custom Features in 'Cities' Screen

## In-Progress Game Information
Once a game has started, the game will remain listed on the Cities screen but with an `[IG]` prefix. This indicates that the lobby is "in-game".
You will not be able to join any in-progress games, and if you try to do so it may cause a network error - meaning that you will have to reconnect.
