# Unlockable Skins

This page explains how to unlock extra skins. It applies to both Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) and Deadlocked (Gladiator). The process is also the same whether you are using PS2 or emulator.

You may know that in the past you had to use a special user name to unlock the skins. _This is no longer needed!_ Just follow the steps below.

1. In the `#bot-commands` channel of the Horizon Discord, type the following: `/uya skins [username]` (for UYA) or `/deadlocked skins [username]` (for DL). Be sure to include the slash, and space before your username. For the username, use the exact UYA or DL profile name that you want to use the custom skin with (not your Discord user name).
2. The Helga Discord bot will reply to your message and show a list of cheat codes for all unlockable skins.
3. In UYA or DL, go to the profile edit page of the profile that you want to use the custom skin with.
4. Hold down the L2 button. While holding down L2, enter the cheat code from step 2 using your D-pad.
5. A message will pop up similar to what is shown below for UYA, indicating that you have unlocked the desired skin. Press OK.
6. Press circle to save your profile.
