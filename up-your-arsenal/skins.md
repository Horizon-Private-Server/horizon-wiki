# Unlockable Skins

This page explains how to unlock extra skins. It applies to both Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet & Clank 3) and Deadlocked (Gladiator). The process is also the same whether you are using PS2 or emulator.

You may know that in the past you had to use a special user name to unlock the skins. _This is no longer needed!_ Just follow the steps below.

1. Go to the profile edit page of the profile that you would like to use the custom skin with.
2. In the `#bot-commands` channel of the Horizon Discord, type the following: `!skins [your profile name]`. Be sure to include the exclamation point, and space before your profile name.
3. The Big Al discord bot will reply to your message and show a list of cheat codes for all unlockable skins.
4. Back on your PS2 or emulator, hold down the L2 button. While holding down L2, enter the cheat code using your D-pad.
5. A message will pop up similar to what is shown below, indicating that you have unlocked the desired skin. Press circle to save your profile.
