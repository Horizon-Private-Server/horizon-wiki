This section is a guide on how to connect to Horizon and play online. 

Select the link at the bottom of this page based on your platform!

_PLEASE NOTE - Regardless of platform, the following versions of the game are currently playable online:_
- Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3):
  - NTSC-U/C (North America)
  - PAL (Europe)
- Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator):
  - NTSC-U/C (North America)
  - PAL (Europe)*
- Unfortunately, there is _NOT_ crossplay between the PS2 and PS3 versions of either game. However, the PS3 version online servers are also playable. Check the `#other-servers` channel in our Discord for details. Also, if you have a backward compatible PS3 you can play the PS2 games online.

_*Note: Deadlocked custom maps currently work on NTSC-U/C only._
