## Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration Guide

### Download and Install PCSX2
1. Download the "Latest Nightly" release of PCSX2 for your operating system from [the PCSX2 website](https://pcsx2.net/downloads/#nightly-anchor).  
   > If you are on Windows and have trouble figuring out which version to download (AVX2 Qt vs SSE4 Qt vs just Qt), check out the [detailed PCSX2 system requirements](https://pcsx2.net/docs/usage/setup/#requirements-to-use-nightly-pcsx2-builds).  
2. Unzip the file using [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), then move it into the directory you would like to run it from. This build does not have an installer file, so once you extract and move the files they are essentially "installed". See below for an example of what the "installed" folder looks like.  
3. If desired, pin the `pcsx2___.exe` file (the `.exe` file that is NOT named "updater") to your Desktop and/or Start Menu. Then open it.

### Configure PCSX2 BIOS
4. In PCSX2, go to the Settings menu → BIOS.  
- If you have already set up a different version of PCSX2, you can use the same BIOS by clicking the "Browse..." button and navigating to your existing BIOS folder. Or you can copy the BIOS files into the default folder specified.  
- If you haven’t used PCSX2 yet, you will have to obtain the BIOS from your PS2 - see the instructions [here](https://pcsx2.net/guides/basic-setup/#how-to-dump-your-ps2-bios). Then either move the files into the default folder specified, or use the "Browse..." button to select the folder the files are in.  
- Once you have a valid BIOS folder selected, the BIOS will show up in the "BIOS Selection" list similar to what is shown below.

### Configure PCSX2 Emulation and Graphics Settings

5. Go to Settings → Emulation and adjust as shown below. You may not need to change any of the settings on this screen.

![img](/assets/pcsx2/Guide-2023Feb/pcsx2-2023Feb-settings_emulation_v2.png)

6. Go to Settings → Graphics and adjust as follows.  
   a) The Renderer and Adapter drop downs are machine dependent. In general, for the Adapter drop down choose your graphics card.  
   b) Set up the "Display" tab as shown in the first image below.  
   c) Set up the "Rendering" tab as shown in the second image below.  
   d) The other tabs within the Graphics settings can be left as is.  
> Note that the graphics settings shown are intended to be a baseline that will provide smooth gameplay on mid-range machines. If you have a high-end gaming computer and/or would like to maximize the visual appearance of the games, please [check the FAQ below](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#faq).

### Configure PCSX2 Network Settings (Sockets/Horizon)
> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** The settings shown in this section represent the simplest possible PCSX2 network setup _**for UYA/Ratchet & Clank 3 and Deadlocked/Gladiator.**_ These settings _may or may not work_ for other PS2 titles. If you plan on playing other PS2 titles online in addition to Horizon-supported titles, you may want to [check the FAQ below](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#faq) for an alternate network setup. The alternate setup is more complex, but it should still work for Horizon-supported titles and will likely work for a wider variety of titles overall.  
7. Download the [internal DNS file here](/assets/cheats/pcsx2_template_hosts.ini) (visit the link, right click the "Raw" button near the top right, then "Save As"). Save it into your PCSX2 folder.

8. Go to Settings → Network & HDD and configure as follows:  
   a) Check the "Enabled" box under Ethernet.  
   b) Set the Ethernet Device Type to "Sockets".  
   c) Set the Ethernet Device to "Auto".  
   d) Leave the Intercept DHCP tab as is, and click on the Internal DNS tab.  
   e) Click "Import". Select the internal DNS file you downloaded in the previous step, then click OK.  
   f) A pop-up window should appear indicating that DNS Hosts were imported successfully. Click OK.  
   The resulting Network & HDD screen should look something like what is shown below (except for the yellow arrow).  

![img](/assets/pcsx2/Guide-2023Feb/pcsx2-2023Feb-settings_network.png)

### Configure PCSX2 Controller Settings and Load Games

9. Go to Settings → Controllers and map your controller (note that the Controller settings do not show up in the same window you may have worked in for the previous few steps, but are available if you close that window then open the Settings menu again).

10. Obtain your ISO for UYA/R&C 3 or Deadlocked/Gladiator, if you have not already done so. Then, in the main window of PCSX2 select the "Add Game Directory..." button and browse to the folder that you saved the ISO(s) in. Once you do this, the main window will change to show a list of ISOs in the folder.

11. **This step only applies if you have a PAL or NTSC-J version of the game/ISO. It can be ignored if you have an NTSC-U/C version of the game/ISO.** Download the DNAS patcher tool from [this webpage](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/) ("DNAS_PATCHER18.7z" has been verified to work). Then extract it with 7-zip and follow the instructions on the webpage to run it on your Ratchet & Clank 3 and/or Gladiator PAL/NTSC-J ISO(s).


### Final Network Setup In Game (Sockets/Horizon)

12. Start the game, navigate to Multiplayer → Online Play, and click Square to access the network setup tool. Click "Add Setting" and run through the steps to create a new network configuration.  
   a) For "Are a user ID and password required to access your provider?" select "Not Required."  
   b) For "Set the IP address automatically?" select Auto.  
   c) For "Set the DNS server address automatically?" select **Manual.**   
   d) On the screen where you enter the DNS server address, enter the DNS: `192.0.2.1` for the 'Primary DNS', matching what is pointed out by the yellow arrow above. The 'Secondary DNS' should be left blank.
> Why enter `192.0.2.1` for the Primary DNS address and not one of the options listed in the `#how-to-play` channel of the Horizon Discord server? Using `192.0.2.1` allows access to the internal DNS addresses you downloaded and imported above. In non-technical terms, it is like a compass that points you to the correct DNS depending on which version of the game you have. **`192.0.2.1` does NOT apply for PS2 players, or PCSX2 players using PCAP.** For more details regarding different ways to connect, [check the FAQ below](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#faq).  

13. Exit the Network Setup tool and navigate back to the multiplayer screen. Click Online Play again and connect to the network.


### Creating a Profile and Logging In

14. From the profile selection/login screen, create a profile if needed.  
   - For the "Save Password" option, choose Yes and type in a password. You will not need to remember this password unless your memory card data gets corrupted, but saving the password means that you will not have to enter it each time you want to log in. You will also need to know your password if you later decide that you want to access your account from a different device (e.g. a PS2).
   - For PAL/NTSC-J users, choose the "Europe" region.

15. Save your profile and log in. That's it!

### High-End Gaming Computers and Graphics  
If you have a high-end gaming computer, and/or would like to maximize the visual appearance of the games, check out these tips!

#### Global Graphics Settings
Here are a few things to try in the Settings → Graphics window.  
- In the "Rendering" tab, you can try increasing the "Internal Resolution" beyond 720p - but note that this may cause frame lag in-game.  
- Automatic/Vulkan is the preferred renderer, and Direct3D11 may help you get higher speed.  
- Anisotropic filtering is not necessary but causes next to no speed penalty (on fast computers).  
- If you are using 4x Native or higher resolution, try changing the "Bilinear Filtering" setting on the "Display" tab to "Bilinear (Sharp)".  

#### Game-Specific Graphics Settings
Graphics settings can also be customized for each individual ISO/title in your PCSX2 game library (example image below). This allows you to experiment and optimize performance for each one. To access the settings for a specific game, right-click on it in the main PCSX2 window list and select "Properties". Then, select "Graphics" in the sidebar.  
- On most modern monitors, both UYA/R&C 3 and Deadlocked/Gladiator will look better in 16:9 aspect ratio so you can set that here.  
- Widescreen patches can also help for some titles. To use these, check the "Enable Widescreen Patches" setting.  
- For UYA/R&C 3 specifically, there is a 16:9 patch that isn't in PCSX2's archive (as of this writing). To use 16:9 here, you can boot the PS2 BIOS, go to its configuration, and set the aspect ratio to "Full". This will allow both UYA/R & C 3 and Deadlocked/Gladiator to boot with their built in 16:9 enabled.

### Getting Online with Other PS2 Titles
Do the step-by-step instructions above also work for other PS2 titles besides the ones that Horizon supports? **Mostly, to the best of our knowledge! But read on.** Although Horizon staff cannot provide detailed technical support/documentation for other PS2 titles, we play them ourselves and we realize that this guide may be useful to others in the PS2 revival community. In practice, most of the same steps above should apply for getting online with any PS2 title that has been revived. The main difference will lie in the network setup.  
Network setup happens in a few different places:  
- PCSX2's Settings → Network & HDD window,  
- The in-game Network Setup tool, and...  
- Various mods and hacks such as DNAS Bypass, etc. (not required for all titles)  

For some titles, the [alternate Network Setup (Nmap/PCAP)](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#alternate-network-setup-nmappcap) detailed below will work without any further steps. For others, extra steps are required. Requirements can vary on a game-by-game basis. Here are some helpful resources for checking the requirements of each title:  
- [Official List of all PS2 Online Games](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbxOGm4dPxZ4Vbzyu3XxBnZmuPx3Ue-cPqBeTxtnvkQ/edit#gid=0) - Includes some setup-related information for each game.  
- [PS2 Online Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zE79nWT) - Includes a channel for each game. Check the pinned messages for setup requirements.  
- [PS Rewired Discord](https://discord.gg/VfeuF6ZWVb) - Includes a channel for each game that has been revived by 1UP and K3rber0s.

### Alternate Network Setup (Nmap/PCAP)
If you plan on playing other PS2 titles online in addition to Horizon-supported titles, you may want to use this alternate network setup. It is more complex than the [Sockets/Horizon setup detailed above](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#configure-pcsx2-network-settings-socketshorizon), but it should still work for Horizon-supported titles and will likely work for a wider variety of titles overall.

To use this alternate setup, substitute these steps instead of the corresponding step number above:  

7. (alternate) Visit [this link](https://nmap.org/download) and find the "Latest stable release" of Nmap for your operating system. Download and install it.  

8. (alternate) In PCSX2, go to Settings → Network & HDD and configure as follows:  
- Check the "Enabled" box under Ethernet.  
- For Wired/Ethernet connections, set up as shown on the left side of the image below. The selected Ethernet device should include "Ethernet" in the name. If there are multiple and one isn't working, try a different one.  
- For Wireless/WiFi connections, set up as shown on the right side of the image below. The selected Ethernet device should include "WiFi" in the name. If there are multiple and one isn't working, try a different one. To get the "PS2 Address" pointed out by the blue arrow, run Command Prompt’s ipconfig tool (or equivalent). Enter in your IPv4 address from your ipconfig output, but change the last digit. For example, if your IP address ends in 142 change it to 143. The reason for this is so that the PS2 is assigned a different address than other devices connected to your network. If possible, check your router setup page to see all IP addresses using your network.  

The other part that is different is the correct DNS address to enter as the 'Primary DNS' in step 12 above.  
- The DNS above should not be used unless you are using Internal DNS.  
- The Horizon DNS listed in our `#how-to-play` channel will only work for UYA and DL.  
- Cristian's DNS (as listed in the [PS2 Online Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zE79nWT)) will work for many PS2 titles.  
- 1UP/K3rber0s' DNS (as listed in the [PS Rewired Discord](https://discord.gg/VfeuF6ZWVb)) will work for many PS2 titles.  

Note that it is possible to create up to four network setup configurations using the in-game tool, each with a different DNS address. Many community members have multiple configurations set up so that they can easily switch between them.

### I am still having trouble connecting! Help!
_First, please note that you will always need to reboot the game after changing PCSX2 settings, for the changes to take effect._  
Connection issues can happen in one of four places, as listed below:  

#### a) **Cannot select "Online Play" in main Multiplayer menu**
This is likely because you did not check the "Enabled" Ethernet setting in Settings → Network & HDD. For PCAP connections, you may also need to install Nmap as explained in the [previous FAQ section](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#alternate-network-setup-nmappcap).  

#### b) **Timeout/error message on "Connecting to Network" screen**
This is usually caused by an incorrect "Ethernet Device" selection in PCSX2's Network and HDD settings. Please revisit the [Sockets/Horizon network setup](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#configure-pcsx2-network-settings-socketshorizon) or the [Nmap/PCAP network setup](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#alternate-network-setup-nmappcap) (depending on which one you are trying to use) and carefully review the steps and screenshots. You should be able to visit your computer's network settings to match up device names with what is shown in the PCSX2 drop down list.  

#### c) **Timeout/error message on DNAS Authentication screen**
This is usually caused by an incorrect "Ethernet Device Type" selection in PCSX2's Network and HDD settings. Please revisit the [Sockets/Horizon network setup](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#configure-pcsx2-network-settings-socketshorizon) or the [Nmap/PCAP network setup](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#alternate-network-setup-nmappcap) (depending on which one you are trying to use) and carefully review the steps and screenshots.  

#### d) **Error message on profile selection/login screen**
This has a wide variety of causes. Every once in a while our servers are down, so double check with us that they are online. Sometimes, the connection is also blocked by your firewall or ISP. Ask us in our `#tech-support` channel and we can try to help.  

#### Some other things that you can try:  
   - If the Sockets/Horizon network setup is not working, try the Nmap/PCAP network setup and vice versa.  
   - If you are trying to get online with a WiFi connection, try using a wired Ethernet connection instead if possible. Even if you can only use Ethernet temporarily, the ability (or lack thereof) to get online that way can help rule out certain causes of the issue.  
   - If you are using a PAL or NTSC-J BIOS and ISO, try an NTSC-U/C BIOS and ISO if possible.  

#### If none of this works, don't get discouraged!
This is the single most common problem that new PCSX2 users have. We have several Horizon staff and community members in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/horizonps) that are vey knowledgeable and may still be able to help. Please don't hesitate to ask us in the `#tech-support` channel of the Discord. Be sure to specify which place your issue is in (i.e. a, b, c, or d above). Screenshots of your PCSX2 Network & HDD Settings screen are very helpful, as are DNAS error numbers if that is where it is failing. Sometimes we can even hop in one of the voice channels to help you in real time.
