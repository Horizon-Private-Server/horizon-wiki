# Using PCSX2 1.7 (February 2023 Nightly Build from PCSX2 website)

This is a guide on how to configure a recent PCSX2 1.7 "nightly build". The screenshots use v1.7.4009 which was released on 4 February 2023.  
_If you find that this guide is out of date, please let us know in the [Horizon Discord](https://discord.gg/horizonps) and we will try to update it when we have time._    

Set up as follows:

### Download and Install Nmap
1. Visit [this link](https://nmap.org/download) and find the "Latest stable release" of Nmap for your operating system. Download and install it. **This has to be done in order to play any PS2 game online in PCSX2.**

### Download and Install PCSX2
2. Download the "Latest Nightly" release of PCSX2 from [the PCSX2 website](https://pcsx2.net/downloads/#nightly-anchor). If you are on Windows and have trouble figuring out which version to download (AVX2 Qt vs SSE4 Qt vs just Qt), check out the [detailed PCSX2 system requirements](https://pcsx2.net/docs/usage/setup/#requirements-to-use-nightly-pcsx2-builds).  
3. Unzip the file using [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), then move it into the directory you would like to run it from. This build does not have an installer file, so once you extract and move the files they are essentially "installed". See below for an example of what the "installed" folder looks like.  
4. If desired, pin the `pcsx2___.exe` file (the `.exe` file that is NOT named "updater") to your Desktop and/or Start Menu. Then open it.

### Configure PCSX2 BIOS
5. In PCSX2, go to the Settings menu → BIOS.
   - If you have already set up a different version of PCSX2, you can use the same BIOS by clicking the "Browse..." button and navigating to your existing BIOS folder. Or you can copy the BIOS files into the default folder specified.
   - If you haven’t used PCSX2 yet, you will have to obtain the BIOS from your PS2 - see the instructions [here](https://pcsx2.net/guides/basic-setup/#how-to-dump-your-ps2-bios). Then either copy it into the default folder specified, or use the "Browse..." button to select the folder you have saved the BIOS into.
   - Once you have a valid folder selected, the BIOS will show up similar to what is shown below.

7. Go to Settings → Graphics and adjust as follows (Note that the settings shown are intended to be a baseline that will provide smooth gameplay on mid-range machines. If you have a high-end gaming computer, please check out FAQ #7 below).  
   a) The Renderer and Adapter settings are obviously machine dependent. In general, for the Adapter drop down choose your graphics card.  
   b) Set up the "Display" tab as shown in the first image below. The Aspect Ratio selection between 4:3 and 16:9 is personal preference.  
   c) Set up the "Rendering" tab as shown in the second image below.  
   d) The other tabs within Graphics settings can be left as is (but again, if you have a high-end gaming computer you may want to experiment with them).

### Configure PCSX2 network settings

8. Download the [internal DNS file here](/assets/cheats/pcsx2_template_hosts.ini) (visit the link, right click the "Raw" button near the top right, then "Save As"). Save it into your PCSX2 folder.

9. Go to Settings → Network & HDD and configure as follows/shown below:
   a) Check the "Enabled" box under Ethernet.  
   b) Set the Ethernet Device Type to "Sockets".  
   c) Set the Ethernet Device to "Auto".  
   d) Leave the Intercept DHCP tab as is, and click on the Internal DNS tab.  
   e) Click "Import". Select the internal DNS file you downloaded in the previous step, then click OK.  
   f) A pop-up window should appear indicating that DNS Hosts were imported successfully. Click OK.  
   The resulting Network & HDD screen should look something like what is shown below (except for the yellow arrow).

### Configure PCSX2 controller settings and load games

10. Go to Settings → Controllers and map your controller (note that the Controller settings do not show up in the same window you may have stayed in for the previous few steps, but are available if you close that window then open the Settings menu again).

11. Obtain your ISO for UYA/R&C 3 or Gladiator/Deadlocked, if you have not already done so. Then, in the main window of PCSX2 select the "Add Game Directory..." button and browse to the folder that you saved the ISO(s) in. Once you do this, the main window will change to show a list of ISOs in the folder.

12. **This step only applies if you have a PAL or NTSC-J version of the game/ISO. It can be ignored if you have an NTSC-U/C version of the game/ISO.** Download the DNAS patcher tool from [this webpage](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/) ("DNAS_PATCHER18.7z" has been verified to work). Then extract it with 7-zip and follow the instructions on the webpage to run it on each ISO file.


### Final network setup in game

13. Start the game, navigate to Online Play, and click Square to access the network setup tool. Click "Add Setting" and run through the steps to create a new network configuration.
   a) For "Are a user ID and password required to access your provider?" select "Not Required."  
   b) For "Set the IP address automatically?" select Yes.  
   c) For "Set the DNS server address automatically?" select **No.**   
   d) On the screen where you enter the DNS server address, enter the DNS: `192.0.2.1` for the 'Primary DNS', matching what is pointed out by the yellow arrow above (click here for why).  
     The 'Secondary DNS' should be left blank.
   
14. Exit the Network Setup tool, connect to the network, create a profile, and log in. That’s it!


## FAQ
### Q1:
**I started the game and I can't even select the "Online Play" button! It is greyed out and the screen says that no network adapter is detected. Help!** 
It is likely that you did not install Nmap, or that it did not install correctly. To fix this:
   a) Close PCSX2.  
   b) Revisit and complete the [Nmap installation section above](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#download-and-install-nmap).  
   c) Reopen PCSX2 and revisit the [PCSX2 network setup section above](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md#configure-pcsx2-network-settings).  
   d) Try getting online again.


### Q2:
**I did everything you said but when I try to connect to the network it times out! (I don't even see the DNAS Authentication screen). How to fix this?**
This is most likely caused by an incorrect "Ethernet Device" selection in PCSX2's Network and HDD settings (step 9 above). First, exit the game completely (System → Shutdown). Then change the setting. Remember, you should be able to visit your computer's network settings to verify the name of the device. After saving your changes, reboot the game and try again.


### Q3:
**I am able to connect to the network but I get DNS error -612 on the DNAS Authentication screen. How to fix this?**
This is most likely caused by an incorrect "Ethernet Device Type" selection in PCSX2's Network and HDD settings (step 9 above). First, exit the game completely (System → Shutdown). Then change the settings as follows:
   - If you previously selected "PCAP Switched", try "PCAP Bridged."
   - If you previously selected "PCAP Bridged", try "PCAP Switched."
   - If neither of those works, try the other option ("Sockets").
   - After saving each change, reboot the game and try again.

### QX:
**Why do I enter `192.0.2.1` for the Primary DNS address during PCSX2 network setup and not one of the DNS addresses listed in the `#how-to-play` channel of the Horizon Discord server?**
Using `192.0.2.1` allows access to the internal DNS addresses you downloaded and imported above. In non-technical terms, `192.0.2.1` is like a guidebook that is capable of selecting the correct DNS for you depending on which version of the game you have.


### Q5:
**I am using Wi-Fi. I read Q1-Q3 and tried everything and it still isn't connecting! Help?**
At this point it will be difficult for us to help you without being able to see your screen in real time. But here are a few ideas of other things you can try.
   - If possible, try using a wired Ethernet connection and configuring as shown in Step 9 above. Even if you can only use Ethernet temporarily, the ability (or lack thereof) to get online that way can help rule out certain causes of the issue.
   - If you absolutely cannot use a wired connection, go back into the Network and HDD Settings and triple-check that you have Ethernet enabled, and PCAP Bridged and Wi-Fi selected. Then, uncheck the "Auto" box next to Subnet Mask and Gateway Address. Then run Command Prompt’s ipconfig tool (or equivalent) again, and enter in the Subnet Mask and Gateway Address from your ipconfig output. You could also try a different last digit in the PS2 Address.
   - If you are using a PAL or NTSC-J BIOS and ISO, try an NTSC-U/C BIOS and ISO if possible.
   - After saving each change, reboot the game and try again.


### Q5:
**I am able to get online without issue, but in-game things look weird. There are strange reflections and bright items seem to be shifted.**
Go into PCSX2's Graphics Settings and on the "Hacks" tab, change the "Half-Pixel Offset" dropdown to "Special (Texture)." Then restart the game.


### Q6:
**My question isn't answered here. How can I get help?**
Please use the `#tech-support` channel in the [Horizon Discord server](https://discord.gg/horizonps).
- For DNAS issues, please let us know what error code you are seeing (-611, -612, etc.).
- For network connection issues, it is very helpful if you can send a screenshot of your Network and HDD Settings window.


### Q7:
**I have a high-end gaming computer. What tips do you have for improving PCSX2 graphics?**
Here are a few tips!
- You can try increasing the "Internal Resolution" beyond 720p, but note that this may cause frame lag in-game.
- Automatic/Vulkan is the preferred renderer, and Direct3D11 may help you get higher speed.
- Anisotropic filtering is not necessary but causes next to no speed penalty (on fast computers).
- For the shader settings, if you are using about 4x Native or higher Sharp Bilinear with no FXAA is recommended. If 2X Native, then Smooth Bilinear or FXAA can smooth the image out.

### Q8:
**I am still having issues connecting to the server!**
