## Introduction
Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

If possible, we recommend playing both titles on a PS2 for the smoothest gameplay experience (instructions for connecting on a PS2 are available in the Discord server). However, we realize that PS2s are 20+ year old technology, so you may not still have one lying around or wish to invest in one. This overview guide is meant for those who cannot or choose not to get a PS2, and would therefore like to play on emulator.

The PS2 emulator is PCSX2 ( https://pcsx2.net/ ). It can be used on a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. To play any PS2 game on PCSX2, you need the following:
- A BIOS file from a PS2.
- An ISO file for each game you wish to play, or the original PS2 disc for the game.

A quick Internet search will yield detailed guides for how to obtain each of these, and some websites offer downloads of them. ***Depending on where you live, these downloads may or may not be legal. If using an illegal copy of the BIOS and/or ISO, you agree to completely release the UYA Staff, DL Staff, and all other members of the online community from any liability resulting from your actions.***

Like most programs, PCSX2 is upgraded over time and has different versions available for download. We recommend using either PCSX2 1.6.0 or PCSX2 1.7.0. The small table below will help you pick between the two versions.

| When to choose PCSX2 1.6.0 | When to choose PCSX2 1.7.0 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| - You are not very tech-savvy.<br/>- You would rather follow a video tutorial to get set up. | - You are tech-savvy.<br/>- You have a decent to high-end computer.        |

Both versions of PCSX2 require you to have administrative access to the folder that you install PCSX2 into, and enough tech-savviness to move files around between specific folders on your computer.

## PCSX2 1.6.0
To get online with PCSX2 1.6.0:

1. Follow the video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE66gzgi6mk&t=79s 
2. In addition to the steps shown in the video, we recommend enabling the "EE Timing Hack" setting using the steps listed below:

In PCSX2 navigate to Config, then Emulation Settings. Then go to the Game Fixes section. Un-check the "Preset" box. Check the "Enable manual game fixes" box. Check the "EE timing hack" box to enable the setting.

3. This last step ONLY applies if you are using a PAL or NTSC-J ISO/disc. You will need to also download the file linked below and save it into the Cheats folder of your PCSX2 installation. Then open PCSX2 and select "Enable Cheats" from the System menu. Also, when setting up your profile choose "Europe" for the server setting. Again, this last step is not necessary if you are using an NTSC-U/C ISO/disc. You can download the cheat ![here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtjanecek/horizon-wiki/main/assets/cheats/17125698.pnach). (right click, "Save As")

## PCSX2 1.7.0
Many emulator players have reported smoother gameplay using PCSX2 1.7.0, which is technically in beta still. There are two PCSX2 1.7.0 builds that have been tested so far:
- ![1.7.0 build that was meant specifically for Ratchet and Clank online by DeathBySnowMan](test)
- ![Generic 1.7.0 build by TheBananaTart](test)
