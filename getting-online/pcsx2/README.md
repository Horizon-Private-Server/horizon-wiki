# Connecting to Horizon with PCSX2

_NOTE: For Deadlocked players with high end PCs, we recommend using our [DreadZone Online PC Client](/getting-online/dzo) instead of PCSX2 for an easier setup and better graphics._

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

This overview guide is meant for those who would like to play on the [PCSX2 emulator](https://pcsx2.net/) for PS2.


## Setup Requirements

PCSX2 is free and versions exist for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. To play any PS2 game on PCSX2, you need the following:

- A BIOS file from a PS2.
- An ISO file for each game you wish to play, OR the original PS2 disc for the game AND a disc drive with which to read the disc. Furthermore, to play UYA or DL online the ISO file must be for a [version of the game that we support](/getting-online#how-to-play--getting-online). We recommend using an NTSC-U/C ISO if possible, because:  
  - There are fewer steps needed to play online.
  - More people in our community use that version (so more people will be able to help you if you have issues setting it up).
  - For Deadlocked, you'll have access to our custom maps and mods which are not available on the Gladiator PAL server.

A quick Internet search will yield detailed guides for how to obtain both BIOS and ISO files, and some websites offer downloads of them. ***Depending on where you live, these downloads may or may not be legal. If using an illegal copy of the BIOS and/or ISO, you agree to completely release the Horizon staff and community from any liability resulting from your actions.***

Setting up PCSX2 requires you to have administrative, write-level access to the folder that you install PCSX2 into. You also must have enough tech-savviness to move files around between specific folders on your computer.


## PCSX2 1.7 Nightly Build
We recommend using the "Latest Nightly" release of [PCSX2 1.7](https://pcsx2.net/downloads/). There are several reasons why we recommend PCSX2 1.7 and NOT the "Latest Stable" release (PCSX2 1.6):
- The online gameplay experience is smoother. Significant improvements have been made since the time that PCSX2 1.6 was current.
- The CLR DEV9 plugin is not needed.
- 64bit support.
- The software is capable of updating itself at the click of a button - new builds are often released on (you guessed it) a nightly basis.  

### Written Setup Guide

- [PCSX2 1.7 Nightly Build Written Setup Guide - early 2023](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.7Nightly-Feb2023.md) - Use this guide for 1.7 nightly builds released earlier in 2023, before the setup wizard function was implemented.

Note that this video shows Ratchet and Clank 3 (Up Your Arsenal), but the setup process is the same for Gladiator/Deadlocked (Cette vidéo montre Ratchet and Clank 3, mais le processus de configuration est le même pour Gladiator).  

## Other PCSX2 Setup Guides
In case you need to use PCSX2 1.6 for some reason, [here is a guide for that version dating to 2021](/getting-online/pcsx2/1.6.md). Horizon staff recommends using PCSX2 1.7.
