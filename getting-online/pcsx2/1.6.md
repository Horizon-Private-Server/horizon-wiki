# PCSX2 1.6

   > NOTE: In general, the Horizon staff does NOT recommend using PCSX2 1.6. We recommend using the "Latest Nightly" build of PCSX2 1.7. Most Horizon community members also use PCSX2 1.7, and will likely recommend that you upgrade if you are running into issues. For more info, check out our [main PCSX2 setup page](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/tree/main/getting-online/pcsx2).

To get online with PCSX2 1.6:

1. Follow Joey Hall's video tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE66gzgi6mk&t=79s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE66gzgi6mk&t=79s)
2. In addition to the steps shown in the video, we recommend enabling the "EE Timing Hack" setting as follows. In PCSX2 navigate to Config, then Emulation Settings. Then go to the Game Fixes section. Un-check the "Preset" box. Check the "Enable manual game fixes" box. Check the "EE timing hack" box to enable the setting.

3. This last step ONLY applies if you are using a PAL or NTSC-J ISO/disc. You will need to also download the files linked below and save it into the Cheats folder of your PCSX2 installation. Then open PCSX2 and select "Enable Cheats" from the System menu. Also, when setting up your profile choose "Europe" for the server setting. Again, this last step is not necessary if you are using an NTSC-U/C ISO/disc. You can download the R&C3 cheat [here](/assets/cheats/17125698.pnach) and the Gladiator cheat [here](/assets/cheats/D697D204.pnach). (click the three dots near the upper right corner of the page, then "Download").
