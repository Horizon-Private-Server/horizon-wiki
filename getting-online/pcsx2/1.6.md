To get online with PCSX2 1.6:

1. Follow the video tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE66gzgi6mk&t=79s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE66gzgi6mk&t=79s)
2. In addition to the steps shown in the video, we recommend enabling the "EE Timing Hack" setting as follows. In PCSX2 navigate to Config, then Emulation Settings. Then go to the Game Fixes section. Un-check the "Preset" box. Check the "Enable manual game fixes" box. Check the "EE timing hack" box to enable the setting.

3. This last step ONLY applies if you are using a PAL or NTSC-J ISO/disc. You will need to also download the file linked below and save it into the Cheats folder of your PCSX2 installation. Then open PCSX2 and select "Enable Cheats" from the System menu. Also, when setting up your profile choose "Europe" for the server setting. Again, this last step is not necessary if you are using an NTSC-U/C ISO/disc. You can download the cheat [here](/assets/cheats/17125698.pnach). (right click, "Save As")
