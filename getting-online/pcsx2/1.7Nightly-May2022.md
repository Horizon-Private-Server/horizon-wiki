# Using PCSX2 1.7 (May 2022 Nightly Build from PCSX2 website)

This is a guide on how to configure a PCSX2 1.7 "nightly build" from May 2022 (build v1.7.2755).

Set up as follows:

1. ***Install the latest version of Nmap from [this link](https://nmap.org/download) (find the "Latest stable release" for your operating system and download it).*** This has to be done in order to allow for online play.
2. Download the latest PCSX2 Nightly Build from [the PCSX2 website.](https://pcsx2.net/downloads/#nightly-anchor)
3. Unzip the file using 7-zip, then move it into the directory you would like to run it from (this build does not have an installer file).
4. Open PCSX2 using the "pcsx2x64-avx2.exe" file.
5. Go to the Config menu → General Settings, then select the BIOS tab at the top left. You might have to scroll the bar up, to see this tab.
   - If you have already set up a different version of PCSX2, you can use the same BIOS by un-checking the “Use default setting” check box and browsing to your existing BIOS folder. Or you can copy the BIOS files into the default folder specified.
   - If you haven’t used PCSX2 yet, you will have to obtain the BIOS from your PS2 - see the instructions [here](https://pcsx2.net/guides/basic-setup/#how-to-dump-your-ps2-bios).
   - Once you point PCSX2 to the correct location, the BIOS will show up in the list. Select it and hit Apply then OK.
   - Note: If you get a message about creating a "Textures" folder, click OK.
6. Still in the General Settings window, un-check the "Preset" box at the bottom left. This will allow you access to the other settings. Then, change the settings as shown for each of the remaining tabs. Note that some tabs may already have all of the settings configured correctly. When complete, click Apply then OK to exit the General Settings window.

7. Go to Config → Graphics Settings and adjust as shown below. Some of these settings (Renderer, Adapter, etc.) are obviously machine dependent. If you have a very good computer, you can try increasing the "Internal Resolution" beyond 720p, but note that this may cause frame lag in-game. Tabs not shown can be left alone. Click OK to save changes.

8. Go to Config → Gamepad Settings → Pad 1 tab and map your controller.
9. Go to Config → Network and HDD Settings.
   - Check the "Enabled" box under Ethernet.
   - For wired (Ethernet) connections, set up as shown on the left side of the image below. The correct "Ethernet Device" selection may vary slightly, but should be some variation of "Ethernet".
   - For wireless (Wi-Fi) connections, set up as shown on the right side of the image below. The correct "Ethernet Device" selection may vary slightly, but should be some variation of "Wi-Fi". You can check this in your computer's network settings. To get the "PS2 Address", run Command Prompt’s ipconfig tool (or equivalent). Enter in your IPv4 address from your ipconfig output, but change the last number. For example, if your IP address ends in 142 change it to 143. The reason for this is so that the PS2 is assigned a different address than other devices connected to your network. You might also be able to check e.g. your router setup page to see all IP addresses using your network.

10. Obtain your ISO for UYA/R&C 3 or Gladiator/Deadlocked, if you have not already done so. _IMPORTANT: If you have a PAL or NTSC-J version of the game/ISO, download the files [here (R&C3)](/assets/cheats/17125698.pnach) and [here (Gladiator)](/assets/cheats/D697D204.pnach) (right click, "Save As") and place it into the cheats folder of your PCSX2 installation. Then, in the PCSX2 system menu navigate to System → Game Settings → Enable Cheats. OR - download the DNAS patcher [here](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/dnas-net-patcher.22813/) and run it on your ISO file.
If you have an NTSC-U/C version of the game, you can ignore this extra step._
11. Start the game, navigate to Online Play, and click Square to access the network setup tool. Click "Add Setting" and run through the steps to create a new network configuration.
   - For "Are a user ID and password required to access your provider?" select "Not Required."
   - For "Set the IP address automatically?" select Yes.
   - For "Set the DNS server address automatically?" select **No.** 
   - On the screen where you enter the DNS server address, enter the DNS listed in the Information section of the [Horizon Discord server](https://discord.gg/horizonps) for the 'Primary DNS'. The 'Secondary DNS' should be left blank. Note: If using a PAL or NTSC-J ISO, use Cristian's DNS (given in the Discord server).
   - We recommend saving the configuration to match the name of the DNS you chose to use. However, this does not affect anything.
12. Exit the Network Setup tool, connect to the network, create a profile, and log in. That’s it!
