## Introduction

Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

This overview guide is meant for those who would like to play on the PS2.

On PS2, it is possible to play the "old-fashioned way" using a disc, or by using OPL. Instructions for connecting each way are below.

PLEASE NOTE - Before investing in a PS2 and games, double check that you are purchasing a [version of the game that we support](/getting-online#how-to-play--getting-online)!


## NTSC-U/C Disc

If you have an NTSC-U/C game disc (United States/Canada), congratulations! You have the easiest setup of anyone. You only need the following items to connect:
- The basics: PS2, controller, memory card, and NTSC-U/C disc for the game you want to play.
- Network adapter, if you have a "fat" PS2. This is not needed if you have a "slim" PS2, as it is already built-in.
- Network cable, and ability to connect that network cable to your router.

### NTSC-U/C Disc - Video Guide
[Click here for a video tutorial showing how to play on an NTSC-U/C Disc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC7s5P9KKLE). Note that:
- ***The video uses Horizon's old DNS.*** Refer to the `#how-to-play` channel in the Horizon Discord server for the most up-to-date DNS. You can also use Cristian's DNS or 1UP/K3rber0s' DNS to connect. They will all get you to the same place.
- The video shows Deadlocked, but the process is the same for UYA.


### NTSC-U/C Disc - Written Guide
Steps are as follows:
1. Navigate to the Multiplayer area of the game you want to play and select Online Play.
2. Press Square to access Network Setup. Wait for it to load.
3. Select "Add Setting."
4. Save to whichever memory card slot you are using.
5. Select the "SCE/Ethernet (Network Adaptor)" hardware.
6. Select "Not Required" for the next question.
7. For "Set the IP address automatically?" select Auto.
8. For "Set the DNS server address automatically?" select _Manual._
9. Change the "Primary DNS" to what is shown in the Horizon Discord `#how-to-play` channel. You can use the Horizon DNS, Cristian's DNS, or 1UP/K3rber0s' DNS to access UYA or DL on the Horizon server.
10. Wait for the connection test to complete, then save the settings. It is recommended, but not required, to change the name of the setting to match that of the DNS that you chose in step 9.
11. Quit the network settings tool. Then select Online Play again and select the new network setting to connect to the network.
12. If you wish to play on custom maps, also complete the steps in that section below.


## PAL Disc

If you have a PAL disc and are looking to play Ratchet and Clank 3, you can still play online with us! You will be able to play directly with people on Up Your Arsenal (NTSC-U/C version). If you want to play Ratchet: Gladiator, good news! You can play Gladiator online as well using the dedicated Gladiator server. Deadlocked (NTSC-U/C) players will be able to play with you on the Gladiator server.

You will need the following items to connect:
- The basics: PS2, controller, memory card, and PAL disc for the game you want to play.
- Network adapter, if you have a "fat" PS2. This is not needed if you have a "slim" PS2, as it is already built-in.
- Network cable, and ability to connect that network cable to your router.
- USB stick (see details below).
- Free McBoot memory card (see details below).

### PAL Disc - Written Guides
Thanks to some outstanding community members, we have guides in both English and Spanish for how to access our servers on PAL. These links are external to our wiki - if there are any issues with them please let us know on Discord! **One note not covered in these guides: When creating your profile, choose the "Europe" region.**

If you wish to play on custom maps, also complete the steps in that section below.


## OPL

It is also possible to use Open PS2 Loader (OPL). For UYA/R&C 3, you must use USB on OPL version 1.1.0. Other versions, as well as HDD and MX4SIO aren't able to play UYA online. For DL/Gladiator, you should use OPL version 0.9.3 as OPL seems to black screen whenever you use two USBs on later versions of OPL.

We plan on adding detailed instructions for connecting via OPL in the future. In the meantime, please inquire in the `#tech-support` channel of the Horizon Discord server if you are having trouble setting up with OPL.


## Custom Map Setup
Our community members often play on the custom maps created by Horizon staff and community members for both [Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal (NTSC-U/C) / Ratchet & Clank 3 (PAL)](/up-your-arsenal/CMAPS.md) and [Ratchet: Deadlocked (NTSC-U/C)](/deadlocked/CMAPS.md) (_unfortunately, custom maps are not currently available for Ratchet: Gladiator (PAL)_).

In order to join or create lobbies on custom maps, follow the steps below.

### Custom Map Setup - Video Guide
[Click here for a video tutorial showing how to set up custom maps on the PS2](https://youtu.be/ND61nvDr0bM).

### Custom Map Setup - Written Guide
In order to install and use custom maps, you need access to a computer as well as a FAT32 formatted USB drive.
1. Visit the [Horizon website](https://rac-horizon.com/) and find the correct custom map download(s) for your game(s)/region.
2. Insert the USB drive into your computer.
3. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file(s) into the root of your USB drive. Verify that the USB drive has a folder called "uya" (for UYA/R&C 3) and/or "dl" (for DL). Inside of those folder(s) should be a bunch of map files. In the root folder there will also be a readme .txt file and some scripts that you can use to update the maps (check the readme or video guide for detailed update script instructions).
4. Safely eject and insert the drive into your PS2.
5. Once online, use the Start button in the staging screen to access the mod menu and select a custom map. See details [here](/up-your-arsenal/CMAPS.md) for UYA/R&C 3 or [here](/deadlocked/CMAPS.md) for DL.

NOTE: OPL USB users can follow the same process, but they must install custom maps on a **separate** USB drive.
