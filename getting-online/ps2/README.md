## Introduction

Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

Playing both titles on a PS2 is recommended. PS2s will provide the smoothest gameplay experience for both games.

Connecting with a PS2 is also much simpler than connecting with PCSX2. You only need the following items to connect:
- The basics: PS2, controller, memory card, and disc for the game you want to play.
- Network adapter, if you have a "fat" PS2. This is not needed if you have a "slim" PS2, as it is already built-in.
- Network cable, and ability to connect that network cable to your router.
- USB stick (only needed if you have a PAL or NTSC-J PS2 and game disc).
- Free McBoot memory card (only needed if you have a PAL or NTSC-J PS2 and game disc).


## NTSC

If you have an NTSC-U/C PS2 and game disc (United States/Canada), congratulations! You have the easiest setup of anyone.

Coming soon!


## PAL

If you have a PAL or NTSC-J PS2 and are looking to play Ratchet and Clank 3, you can still play online with us! You will be able to play directly with people on Up Your Arsenal (NTSC U/C version). Unfortunately, Gladiator is not supported at this time.

Thanks to some outstanding community members, we have guides in English and Spanish for how to access our servers on a PAL or NTSC-J PS2. These links are both external to our wiki - if there are any issues with them please let us know on Discord!
