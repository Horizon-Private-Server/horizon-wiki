## Introduction

Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

Playing both titles on a PS2 is recommended. PS2s will provide the smoothest gameplay experience for both games.

Connecting with a PS2 is also much simpler than connecting with PCSX2. You only need the following items to connect:
- The basics: PS2, controller, memory card, and disc for the game you want to play.
- Network adapter, if you have a "fat" PS2. This is not needed if you have a "slim" PS2, as it is already built-in.
- Network cable, and ability to connect that network cable to your router.
- USB stick (only needed if you have a PAL or NTSC-J PS2 and game disc). See details below.
- Free McBoot memory card (only needed if you have a PAL or NTSC-J PS2 and game disc). See details below.

_PLEASE NOTE - Regardless of platform, the following versions of the game are currently playable online:_
- Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3):
  - NTSC-U/C (North America)
  - PAL (Europe)
  - NTSC-J (Korean Only - Japanese release not supported)
- Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator):
  - NTSC-U/C (North America)
  - PAL (Europe)


## NTSC-U/C

If you have an NTSC-U/C PS2 and game disc (United States/Canada), congratulations! You have the easiest setup of anyone.

Steps are as follows:
1. Navigate to the Multiplayer area of the game you want to play and select Online Play.
2. Press Square to access Network Setup. Wait for it to load.
3. Select "Add Setting."
4. Save to whichever memory card slot you are using.
5. Select the "SCE/Ethernet (Network Adaptor)" hardware.
6. Select "Not Required" for the next question.
7. For "Set the IP address automatically?" select Auto.
8. For "Set the DNS server address automatically?" select _Manual._
9. Change the "Primary DNS" to what is shown in the Horizon Discord. As of this writing, you can use the Horizon DNS, Cristian's DNS, or 1UP/K3rber0s' DNS to access UYA or DL on the Horizon server.
10. Wait for the connection test to complete, then save the settings. It is recommended, but not required, to change the name of the setting to match that of the DNS that you chose in step 9.
11. Quit the network settings tool. Then select Online Play again and select the new network setting to connect to the network. That's it!

If you prefer, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE66gzgi6mk&t=671s) (external link) walks through the same steps. The video uses Cristian's DNS.


## PAL or NTSC-J

If you have a PAL or NTSC-J PS2 and are looking to play Ratchet and Clank 3, you can still play online with us! You will be able to play directly with people on Up Your Arsenal (NTSC-U/C version). If you want to player Ratchet: Gladiator, good news! You can play Gladiator online as well on the dedicated Gladiator server. Deadlocked (NTSC-U) player will be able to play with you on the Gladiator server.
