## Introduction

Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

This overview guide is meant for those who would like to play on the DreadZone Online PC Client (DZO). DZO is a special emulator for Deadlocked, developed and maintained by Horizon staff.

Please note the following:
- DZO only supports online play. The single player mode of Deadlocked is not available.
- No equivalent for DZO currently exists for Up Your Arsenal. If you want to play UYA/R&C 3 online, use [PCSX2](/getting-online/pcsx2).

To use DreadZone Online, you need the following:

- A BIOS file from a PS2.
- An ISO file for Deadlocked (NTSC-U/C).

A quick Internet search will yield detailed guides for how to obtain both BIOS and ISO files, and some websites offer downloads of them. ***Depending on where you live, these downloads may or may not be legal. If using an illegal copy of the BIOS and/or ISO, you agree to completely release the Horizon staff and community from any liability resulting from your actions.***

Setting up DZO requires you to have administrative, write-level access to the folder that you install it into. You also must have enough tech-savviness to move files around between specific folders on your computer.
