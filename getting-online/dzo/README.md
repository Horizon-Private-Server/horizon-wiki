## Introduction

Welcome to the Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator) online community.

This overview guide is meant for those who would like to play on the DreadZone Online PC Client (DZO). DZO is a special emulator for Deadlocked, developed and maintained by Horizon staff. The benefits of using DZO over PCSX2 for Deadlocked Online are an easier setup process, automatic custom map updates, and better graphics.

Please note the following:
- DZO only supports online play. The single player mode of Deadlocked is not available.
- No equivalent for DZO currently exists for Up Your Arsenal. If you want to play UYA/R&C 3 online on a PC, use [PCSX2](/getting-online/pcsx2).


## Setup Requirements

To use DreadZone Online, you need the following:

- A BIOS file from a PS2.
- An ISO file for Deadlocked (NTSC-U/C).

A quick Internet search will yield detailed guides for how to obtain both BIOS and ISO files, and some websites offer downloads of them. ***Depending on where you live, these downloads may or may not be legal. If using an illegal copy of the BIOS and/or ISO, you agree to completely release the Horizon staff and community from any liability resulting from your actions.***

Setting up DZO requires you to have administrative, write-level access to the folder that you install it into. You also must have enough tech-savviness to move files around between specific folders on your computer.
