# How can I help support Horizon?
There are multiple ways to support the community:
1. Boost the Discord server.
2. Donate to our Patreon - please DM a staff member or moderator for the link.
3. If you cannot or do not wish to contribute financially, there are other ways to help out as well! Some possible examples of this could be hosting regular events on UYA and/or DL to get people online, or answering questions from other community members in the `#tech-support` Discord channel. Staff members will award VIP status (Horizon VIP role) to those who consistently help out.

# Why "Horizon"?
We chose the name "Horizon" because we wanted to get away from the Ratchet and Clank Online branding, and avoid any potential confusion around the R & C name in general. For example if we named the server "Ratchet and Clank: Horizon" some might have thought it was an upcoming game from Insomniac.
