# Horizon Private Server Rules and Policies

This section contains important rules and policies that the Horizon staff has put in place.  
Unless otherwise noted, everything on this page applies in all of the following places:  
- The Horizon Discord server.  
- The Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal/Ratchet and Clank 3 game server that Horizon runs.  
- The Ratchet: Deadlocked/Ratchet: Gladiator game servers that Horizon runs.  
- All test game servers that Horizon runs.  


## Horizon Rules

As listed in the `#rules` channel of the [Horizon Discord server](https://discord.gg/horizonps), all players are expected to follow these rules.
1. Respect each other. No discrimination, persistent insults, or uncomfortable/sensitive issues.  
2. No toxicity. This includes but is not limited to: repeatedly trying to force others to play the games in a certain way, lack of common sense, or being excessively negative or combative.  
3. Please try to keep conversations in the appropriate channels here on Discord. Linking to other Discord servers is also prohibited without prior approval from staff.  
4. Flooding and/or spamming messages is not allowed, nor is any NSFW content.  
5. Violent threats (both written and verbal) are strictly prohibited. These threats will result in immediate [bans](#bans).  Threats against Horizon servers and staff members are also strictly prohibited.  


## Horizon Disciplinary Policy
This section outlines the Horizon Disciplinary Policy.  

### Informal Warnings
Horizon staff members make every effort to help users who violate the rules understand and correct their mistakes. For first-time offenders or those whose offenses are considered mild, an informal warning will usually be the first disciplinary step. These warnings are generally issued in Horizon's public channels, and may be as simple as a moderator or staff member telling the user that their message/comment was out of line. Informal warnings are not formally logged, and carry no long-term consequences.  

### Mutes, Timeouts, and Slowmode
Horizon staff members may use Discord's muting, timeout, and slowmode functionality as they see fit. For example:  
- A user may be muted or timed out if the staff member feels that it is necessary. Muting/timing out the user gives the staff time to discuss as a group and determine whether the user's actions are enough to warrant a formal warning. Mutes and timeouts are generally lifted within 24 hours, and often much sooner.  
- A channel may be put into slowmode temporarily if a staff member notices that the conversation is getting very heated.  

All of these tools are ways that Horizon staff members prevent rapidly escalating situations from escalating further.  

### Formal Warnings
If a user continues to violate the rules above, Horizon staff will generally follow the three-step disciplinary policy outlined here.  

The first time that a user violates the rules ("Warned Once" level):  
- The user will receive a message from a Horizon staff member explaining the warning. This message will be sent in a thread within the Horizon Discord server that is only visible to the staff and the user in question.  
- The user will be given the "Warned Once" role.  
- At the discretion of Horizon staff, the user may be muted for up to 24 hours.  
- The warning will expire in 3 months (the role will be removed) if there are no additional violations.  
- The warning will be permanently logged by Horizon staff.  

The second time that a user violates the rules ("Warned Twice" level):  
- The user will receive a message from a Horizon staff member explaining the warning. This message will be sent in a thread within the Horizon Discord server that is only visible to the staff and the user in question.  
- The user will be blocked from all voice chat channels for 6 months.  
- The user will be given the "Warned Twice" role.  
- At the discretion of Horizon staff, the user may be muted for up to 24 hours.  
- The warning will expire in 6 months (the role will be removed) if there are no additional violations. The warning will be removed completely at that time (not downgraded to "Warned Once").  
- The warning will be permanently logged by Horizon staff.  

### Bans
The third time that a user violates the rules, or for serious violations regardless of previous history:  
- The user will be banned from the Horizon Discord server.  
- At the discretion of the Horizon staff, the user may be banned from the UYA/R&C 3 and/or DL/Gladiator game servers.  
- At the discretion of the Horizon staff, the ban may expire in 9 months (see next section).  
- The ban will be permanently logged by Horizon staff.  
- The ban will not be explained to the user by default. However, the user may DM a Horizon staff member requesting an explanation for the ban.  

### Ban Expiration
On a case by case basis, Horizon offers some banned users a 9 month "ban expiration" privilege. This means that 9 months after the date a user is banned, he/she may be unbanned (from the Discord server, and any game servers as applicable). This part of the policy exists because we believe that even some banned users deserve a second chance. However, ban expiration is a priviledge and not a right for the banned user. Unbanning is a manual process that requires time and effort from Horizon staff.  

Horizon staff will not reach out to banned users to remind them of their "unban date", but banned users may contact a Horizon staff member via direct message on Discord to ask if/when they will be unbanned.  

Horizon staff expects that all community members will treat any previously banned users who choose to rejoin with respect, and give them the same new chance to be a part of the community that we (the staff) are giving them. Of course, Horizon staff will also be keeping a close eye on them. All previously banned users will be started at the "Warned Once" level outlined above, and the 3 month and 6 month warning expirations will not apply (i.e. warnings never expire for previously banned users). Any users who get banned a second time, should assume that the ban is permanent.  

### Exceptions
A couple of exceptions to the above process should be noted:  
- For severe offenses, Horizon staff may skip steps above. For example, as stated in rule #5 violent threats are strictly prohibited - so users who break this rule may be banned immediately even if they have not been previously warned.  
- Discord officially supports account switching, but we discourage the use of multiple Discord accounts because of the confusion it causes for other community members. Any disciplinary steps applied to one of your Discord accounts will also be applied to all of your other Discord accounts that we are aware of. For example, if your main account receives a first formal warning and we know that you also have a second account, that second account would also have the warning applied to it. **Use of Discord alts to evade a Horizon Discord ban is grounds for further action, such as a game server ban and/or revoking of the ban expiration privilege.**  

### Exile from UYA/DL
While we encourage community members to try both UYA/R & C 3 and DL/Gladiator, we recognize that most players do have a clear favorite between the two games (including all Horizon staff members). Unfortunately, we have seen some players take this too far and make it their mission to visit the channels for the other game only to stir the pot and create drama. To address this, the Horizon staff has created "exile roles" and applied them to users as needed. The "Exiled from UYA" role means that all channels in the UYA section will be hidden from the user. The "Exiled from DL" role means that all channels in the DL section will be hidden from the user.  


## Horizon Staff Expectations
You can expect Horizon staff members to try their best to:  
- Treat all community members equally and with respect.  
- Resolve any and all disputes democratically.  If you have an issue, please tag the Moderators role to get our attention.  
- Be transparent and honest with community members at all times.  
- Take community feedback into account as much as possible.  

Thank you for being a part of the Horizon community!
